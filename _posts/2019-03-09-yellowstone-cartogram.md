title: "Cartogram experiment: Yellowstone USA"

Since I now exclusively use Ubuntu, it is more difficult to use my normal cartography tools, i.e., Illustrator and ArcGIS. 
After posting the Upper Geyser Basin map yesterday, I decided to try open source <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> and see if I could make it work.
Anyway, here is a start.
