Hello and welcome! My name is Alan, and I am a geographer. Lately, most of my time has been spent evaluating startups, advising founders, and <a href="https://angel.co/glennon">angel investing</a>. On the side, I am working on a new company called <a href="https://github.com/cakemixlabs">Cakemix</a>.

**Bio:**
<p />
Alan Glennon is a computational geographer and entrepreneur. He earned his PhD in 2013 at the UCSB Department of Geography under <a href="https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~good/">Michael Goodchild</a> investigating spatial computation and geographically embedded networks. Alan has worked with and studied networks in geography for over two decades, starting with field research to map cave and karst watersheds. This initial interest in caves led him to a Master's degree in karst hydrogeology at Western Kentucky University. Concurrently, he worked as a ranger naturalist at Mammoth Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Great Basin National Park. In 1999, Glennon co-founded the WKU Hoffman Environmental Research Institute, a center dedicated to applied research on human interaction with karst landscapes. Upon the founding of UCSB's <a href="http://spatial.ucsb.edu/personnel/alan-glennon/">Center for Spatial Studies</a> in 2008, Glennon worked as the center's first graduate researcher--developing a spatial lunch series, technical software workshops, a weekly help desk, and lightning talks event. From 2015 to 2017, Glennon was co-founder and CEO of transportation logistics software company <a href="https://github.com/arogi">Arogi</a>. Glennon and his wife <a href="https://twitter.com/rmglennon">Rhonda</a> live near San Francisco.
